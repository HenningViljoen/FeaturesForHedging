# FeaturesForHedging

Feature Selection for Hedging (FSH) is a Python app that selects a specified number of securities from a securities universe in order to track a specified target security such as an index, utilising Machine Learning.  A number of different approaches to the problem are executed, and then the selected portfolios are compared and ranked with regards to risk exposure (covariance matrix), as well as tracking accuracy (R^2).  The end goal is to selected a linearly weighted combination of securities into a portfolio.  Various linear regression and other machine learning techniques are used.
